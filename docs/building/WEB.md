# Building Web Application

Building of Web App is separated to two parts: Core Library and Web App itself. Web App uses [actor-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actor-js) library from NPM that is compiled from java sources and published by Actor Team. If you want to fork it, you may ask for support in our oss group, but in almost all cases you don't need this and we strictly don't recommend to do this.

### Requirements

For building web app, you need:
* Node 4.2.2+ Use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for Linux/OSX and [official installer](https://nodejs.org/) for Windows.
