# Configuration file for Actor Applications
# Here you can point apps to your server or tweak some settings

# Specify all available endpoints to your server
#
# Some limitations
# * WebSockets is only way to communicate from Web App with server
# * WebSockets can be only secured with TLS as most browsers disable ws for plain connections
# * TCP/TLS connections is only way to communicate from Mobile Apps
# * We highly recommend to use TLS enabled for mobile apps, but it is not required
