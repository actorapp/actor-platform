Actor is a platform for instant messaging. Actor provides features like large group chats; unlimited history storage; send/receive documents, photo, and video; authentication with one time password for phone number/email or OAuth2; easy integrations with external services.

Actor has one of the best IM apps for Android, iOS, and Web that is built to handle poor connectivity on bad networks, support full offline message and file storage in applications, automatically build contact lists, and more!

The Actor Platform is good for improving enterprise communications, building a message-oriented startup, or building country-wide national messaging. If you are interested in something like this, you can always ask us by sending an email to speed@actor.im.

This repository contains all of the source code you need to start your own server and/or build your own iOS, Android, Web, or Desktop applications.

# Currently available clients
* [Android 4.0.3+](https://actor.im/android)
* [iPhone/iPad 7.0+](https://actor.im/ios)
* [Web](https://app.actor.im/)

It is very easy to [implement your own](http://actor.readme.io/docs/apps).

# Installation

Building a mobile messaging application is quite a complex procedure that requires a lot of preparation, e.g.: have developer accounts with Google and Apple, have SSL certificates for your servers, integrate the server with various services like SMS gate, push systems, etc.

For more info, you can read the [server installation manual](SERVER.md). After installing the server, you can [start building the apps](APPS.md).

# Live demo

Keep in touch with the Actor community in its [group chat](https://quit.email/join/0d43e6a90d108ad9608514b5c17b76d5b2721d5e2ea51058d6ca43a66befe7f4).

# Why Open Source?

It is very hard to find any open source messaging servers that have awesome mobile apps and are good for everyday use, so we started working on Actor. At some point, we realized that the quality of our code was good enough to share it with the open source community.
