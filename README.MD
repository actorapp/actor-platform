This repository contains all source code of platform whereby you can start your server or/and build your iOS, Android, Web, or Desktop applications.

# Installation

Building mobile messaging application is a bit complex procedure and you need certain amount of preparations: have developer accounts in Google, Apple, have SSL certificates for your servers, integrate server with various services like SMS gate, push systems, etc... 

For more info, you can read [server installation manual](SERVER.md). After server installation, you can [start building apps](APPS.md).

# Why Open Source?

It is very hard to find any open source messaging servers that have awesome mobile apps, but if they have they are not so good for everyday use. At some point, we found that the quality of our sources is good enough to share it with a community.
