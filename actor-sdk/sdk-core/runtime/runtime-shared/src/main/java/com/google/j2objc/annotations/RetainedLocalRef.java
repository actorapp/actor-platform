/**
 * Annotation that indicates a local variable should be retained outside of any
 * subsequent AutoreleasePool use. Otherwise, if a local variable has a copy
 * of an object in a container that is removed in an AutoreleasePool, it will
 * be deallocated before the local variable goes out of scope.
 * <p>
 * For example, a ThreadPoolExecutor is used to process a list of tasks,
 * removing each task from the list as it is processed. ThreadPoolExecutor
 * tasks are run inside of an AutoreleasePool, since these executors are often
 * long-lived. If a local variable is initialized to one of the task list's
 * elements, by default that variable won't be valid (will be deallocated)
 * after task processing. Adding a LocalRetain annotation to the local
 * variable ensures it is still valid after task processing.
